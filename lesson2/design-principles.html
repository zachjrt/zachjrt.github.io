<h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

<h3>Disney</h3>
<ul>
  <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney Plus Website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  In this website, Disney plus utilizes visual hierarchy to establish 
  itself as the most important of the broadcasting. Although you are 
  supossed to see that hulu and espn are offered, Disney plus flexes
  it's dominance by making itself larger and more visable.

  <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
  <hr>
  <img id="mobileScreen" alt="Zach Thompson" src="newegg.jpg">
  <h3>Newegg</h3>
  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.newegg.com/">Newegg Website</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Newegg is an online store that sells a wide variety of electronics.
    Finding  one of their thousands of carried products can be quite difficult.
    They have implemented a filtering system where you can firs choose what type 
    of product you want. In this example I used "desktop computers", they then offered
    24 categories to filter it down further, each with their own sub-category. this
    means that the user has all kinds of filtering options while searching for a product.
    This is a good example of a website that would be a nightmare to use, if they didn't follow
    Hick's law.

  <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
  <hr>

  <h3>Amazon</h3>
  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Router-Guard-Large-WiFi/dp/B07MXD75TR/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=wifi+emf&qid=1610682456&sr=8-8">Amazon Product Page</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When shopping online, people often have the aim of buying things.
    Amazon took note of this and made sure the two options that help 
    you to do this, "Add to cart" and "Buy Now", are easily seen and easily clickable.
    Quantity, which is still needed, but used less often is about 20% smaller.
